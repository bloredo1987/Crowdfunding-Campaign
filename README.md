# Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis
Findings:

--On any given month, there have been more successful crowdfunding campaigns than failed campaigns.
June had the highest number of successful campaigns in a single month, suggesting potential seasonal trends, school calendar, or holiday season impact.
August had the highest number of canceled campaigns.

Limitations of the dataset:
--Lack of information on backers count, which prevents understanding the level of success for the successful campaigns and the factors influencing campaign success or failure.
Missing data on the goal/pledge column, making it difficult to assess variations and understand the criteria for setting campaign goals.
Limited data for only one year, hindering a comprehensive understanding of how successful, failed, and canceled campaigns evolve throughout multiple years.

Other possible tables and/or graphs for additional value:
--Pie chart: Illustrating the percentage distribution of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns within each month, providing a visual representation of the proportions.
Stacked bar graph: Displaying the total number of campaigns divided into smaller parts (successful, failed, canceled), allowing for comparison of their sizes and understanding the relative distribution.
These additional visualizations would enhance the understanding of the campaign outcomes, their distribution across months, and the overall patterns within the dataset.
